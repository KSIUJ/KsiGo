#### Testing the sockets:
1. Run `create_server()` function from `server.py`
2. Run **simultaneously** two instances of function `create_player("username")` from `cleint.py`

#### TODO
- line:41 in `server.py` contains the temporary game logic, which has to be changed in the finished game
- Change the `localhost:9999` address (line:7 in `server.py` and line:8 in `client.py`) when we will have a server running
